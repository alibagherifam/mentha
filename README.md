Find nutrition facts using your phone camera!

Mentha is an Android application that finds nutrition facts of the food you are scanning. It uses
image classification and neural networks under the hood.

## ‚öô Technologies

Image classification is based on [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite)
with [EfficientNet-Lite](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/efficientnet/lite2/classification/2) and
[MobileNet](https://tfhub.dev/iree/lite-model/mobilenet_v1_100_224/uint8/1) models.

Other Android technologies:

- Kotlin Coroutines
- AndroidX Camera
- AndroidX Lifecycle
- AndroidX Room
- KSP
- Jetpack Compose
- Material 3
- Coil
- Composite Builds
- Convention Plugins
- Version Catalog

## üìï Terminology

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha):

> "Mentha (also known as mint) is a genus of plants in the family Lamiaceae (mint family)."

As a boy whose childhood was full of stomachaches, the word mentha means as a potion of healing to
me. So I set it as the project's name.

## üí° Inspiration

This was the final project for my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering.
