Find nutrition facts using your phone camera!

Mentha is an Android application that finds nutrition facts by scanning foods using a phone camera.
Under the hood, It performs Image Classification with a MobileNet CNN model over the TensorFlow
framework.

## ‚öô Technologies

The project uses the [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) framework for running the
image classification model on mobile. Currently, the model is based on
the [MobileNet V3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) CNN architecture which has been trained over
the [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org) dataset. You can find it in
the [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/lite-model/imagenet/mobilenet_v3_large_100_224/feature_vector/5/default/1)
. As a future roadmap, I will
use [transform learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker) technique to
customize the model for classifying foods.

Other Android technologies:

- Kotlin Coroutines
- AndroidX Camera
- AndroidX Lifecycle
- AndroidX Room
- KSP
- Jetpack Compose
- Material 3
- Coil
- Composite Builds
- Convention Plugins
- Version Catalog

## üìï Terminology

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha):

> "Mentha (also known as mint) is a genus of plants in the family Lamiaceae (mint family)."

As a boy whose childhood was full of stomachaches, the word mentha means as a potion of healing to
me. So I named the project Mentha.

## üí° Inspiration

This was the final project for the Artificial Intelligence course during my B.Sc. in Computer
Engineering.
