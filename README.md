Find nutrition facts using your phone camera!

Mentha is an Android application that finds nutrition facts by scanning foods using a phone camera.
Under the hood, It performs Image Classification with a MobileNet CNN model over the TensorFlow
framework.

## ‚öô Technologies

The project uses the [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) framework to run the image
classification model on an android device. The model is
a [MobileNet V3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) CNN architecture trained over
the [ILSVRC](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/overview/description)
dataset, a subset of [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org). It is available
on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/lite-model/imagenet/mobilenet_v3_large_100_224/feature_vector/5/default/1)
.

> :warning: **The current model supports
a [limited number](/image-classifier/src/main/java/dev/alibagherifam/mentha/imageclassifier/AllowedLabels.kt)
of food classes**. As a future roadmap, I will use
> the [transfer learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker) technique to
> customize the model for a broader range of food classes.

## üìï Terminology

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha):

> "Mentha (also known as mint) is a genus of plants in the family Lamiaceae (mint family)."

As a boy whose childhood was full of stomachaches, the word mentha means as a potion of healing to
me. So I named the project Mentha.

## üí° Inspiration

This was the final project for the Artificial Intelligence course during my B.Sc. in Computer
Engineering.
