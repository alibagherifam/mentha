Find nutrition facts using your phone camera!

Mentha is an Android application that finds nutrition facts by scanning foods using a phone camera.
Under the hood, It performs Image Classification with a MobileNet CNN model over the TensorFlow
framework.

## ‚öô Technologies

The project uses [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) framework for machine learning
on mobile.

Currently, the ML model is
a [pre-trained one](https://tfhub.dev/iree/lite-model/mobilenet_v1_100_224/uint8/1) from
Tensorflow Hub. It is based on the [MobileNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) CNN architecture
and was trained over the [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) dataset. As a future roadmap, I will
replace this model with a custom one.

Other Android technologies:

- Kotlin Coroutines
- AndroidX Camera
- AndroidX Lifecycle
- AndroidX Room
- KSP
- Jetpack Compose
- Material 3
- Coil
- Composite Builds
- Convention Plugins
- Version Catalog

## üìï Terminology

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentha):

> "Mentha (also known as mint) is a genus of plants in the family Lamiaceae (mint family)."

As a boy whose childhood was full of stomachaches, the word mentha means as a potion of healing to
me. So I named the project Mentha.

## üí° Inspiration

This was the final project for the Artificial Intelligence course during my B.Sc. in Computer
Engineering.
